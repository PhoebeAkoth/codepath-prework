2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The challenge: Step 9 “Checking the users’ response”
What I found most challenging in the light and sound memory game was understanding the logical flow of the game.When watching the demo video I came across words like “secret pattern”, “clues”, “sequence” and “turns”. At first all these words seemed like an overload of information. From the video I could see messages being displayed “Game over, you lost” or “Game over, you won!” but i did not understand at what point these statements should be displayed in the game. This showed I needed to understand the game a little bit more in order to know when the user has won and when the user has lost and what actions follow after.

How I solved it.
After watching the video several times  and realizing that what I had trouble with was understanding  the logical flow. I called on my peers Andrew and Michelle. We watched the demo video together and tried to explain to each other how the game worked and when to display the user has won and when to display the user has lost. I later came back and watched the video myself, this time transferring exactly what the person in the video said into my notes( see screenshot 1 https://github.com/PhoebeAkoth/codepath-prework/issues/4) .  I came to understand that a user has 8 turns and if at any turn they click the wrong button or clue and mess with the sequence they would have lost the game . However, if they went the whole 8 turns without messing up the sequence as in when they clicked all the right buttons or clues they would have won.(screen shot 2 below)

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After completing my submission I have the following questions about web development:
What are some of the measures that  web developers take to ensure their websites are user friendly and intuitive? Do those measures in any way delay the release of websites to the public? If so, are there any other cost efficient and time efficient ways to test user friendliness and at the same time ensure that the website is available to the masses on time? What are the least fun parts of creating a website ? Also what are the most fun and rewarding  parts about creating a website?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more time on this project I would definitely spend more time on the CSS part. I would make the game even more colorful and incorporate  graphic design and more images to make the website exciting. I would also like to give the user statistics on each time they play the game on how much they have improved from the last time they played. This ensures that after they play they can see the progress they made.Even though the game is on a single web page I would like to incorporate one more  web page where the  users statistics are incorporated after they have won or lost the game.
